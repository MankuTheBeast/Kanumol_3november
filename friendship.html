    <h2>How the friendship and crush phase went?</h2>

    <p>
      Our friendship started on 29 August when I sent you this question along
      with some text as in here:
    </p>
    <img
      class="texting"
      src="imgs/Screenshot_20221031-125855_WhatsApp.jpg"
      height="500px"
    />
    <p>
      Then both of us will try to message each other occasionally and meet each
      other in centre, randomly, maybe just to talk I suppose (?)
    </p>
    <p>
      The dates on which we both texted each other, no matter who texted first
      are: 29th, 31st of August; 2nd to 11th, 13th to 18th, 20th to 23rd, 25th
      to 30th September; and the most shocking and loving, the whole month of
      October. There's something related to this in
      <a href="songs_dedicated.html">the songs I dedicated to you</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      You also gave me the best bday gift ever, a picture, which I still have
      with me 🥺 and this:
    </p>
    <p class="birthday_wish">
      Happiest birthday Anmol 🦋.. stay blessed always👋😇 ..hun tan vadde ho
      gayee 😂.. gal krde hoye thoda ghat haseya krya karo 🤦‍♀.. menu kade

    </p>

    <p>
      Going to take doubts in Aakash together, to asking you on going on date
      and you rejecting it 😔 and giving you chocolates and writing these things
      like this <a href="past_writings.html">in here</a> about you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally on the evening of 2nd November, I got the courage to ask you to be
      mine by following:
    </p>
    <p class="proposal">
      Music is the best to communicate, <br />
      I dont want me to Hallucinate.<br />
      I gave you hints, <br />
      I guess maybe clear to see.<br />
      But maybe they had tints,<br />
      So Guess they only appeared clear to me.<br />
      I don't know,<br />
      If its the time.<br />
      But if the goes,<br />
      It will not come to hand of mine.<br />
      I hope you dont get mad,<br />
      Then guess Im pretty glad.<br />
      Don't just put on a rejection,<br />
      Take your time, and do an action<br />
      I know there's a lot of risk from my side.<br />
      I dont want to lose a good friend of mine.<br />
      I have already told you how good you are.<br />
      And what I have felt till now so far.
    </p>
