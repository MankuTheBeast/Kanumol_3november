    <h2>How the friendship and crush phase went?</h2>

    <p>
      Our friendship started on 29 August when I sent you this question along
      with some text as in here:
    </p>
    <img src="imgs/Screenshot_20221031-125855_WhatsApp.jpg" height="500px" />
    <p>
      Then both of us will try to message each other occasionally and meet each
      other in centre, randomly, maybe just to talk I suppose (?)
    </p>
    <p>
      The dates on which we both texted each other, no matter who texted first
      are: 29th, 31st of August; 2nd to 11th, 13th to 18th, 20th to 23rd, 25th
      to 30th September; and the most shocking and loving, the whole month of
      October. There's something related to this in
      <a href="songs_dedicated.html">the songs I dedicated to you</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Going to take doubts in Aakash together, to asking you on going on date
      and you rejecting it ðŸ˜” and giving you chocolates and writing these things
      like this <a href="past_writings.html">in here</a> about you.
    </p>
    <p>Finally on</p>
